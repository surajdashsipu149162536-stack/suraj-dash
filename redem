1. USB Microphone System Analysis
This section explains the analog front-end of a USB microphone setup and its role in signal conditioning and conversion.
Circuit Overview:

Input Capacitor ( C_i = 4.7 \mu F ): Blocks DC and allows AC signals to pass.
Resistors ( R_i = R_f = 5k\Omega ): Define gain and time constant of the filter.
Op-Amp: Configured in non-inverting mode to amplify the filtered signal.
S-Domain Transfer Function:

H(s) = (Rf * s * Ci) / (1 + s * Ri * Ci)

At low frequencies (s â†’ 0), H(s) â†’ 0 â†’ High attenuation of low-frequency signals.
At high frequencies (s â†’ âˆž), H(s) â†’ Rf / Ri = 1 â†’ Passes high frequencies with gain 1.
ðŸ”» Cutoff Frequency (fc):
fc = 1 / (2Ï€RiCi)

For Ri = 5kÎ©, Ci = 4.7Î¼F:

fc â‰ˆ 6.77 Hz
