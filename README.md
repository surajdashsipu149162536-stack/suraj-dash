Question 1: Determine the type of circuit
Answer:
The given circuit is an active high-pass filter implemented using an inverting op-amp configuration. The input signal passes through a capacitor followed by a resistor, which together form the high-pass filtering stage. The op-amp amplifies the filtered signal with a gain determined by the ratio of the feedback and input resistors.
